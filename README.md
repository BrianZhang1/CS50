CS50 2020 Fall!

I completed cs50 and did most of the labs/psets. Didn't do all of them since I didn't realize there were psets and labs until like week 5, and I was too lazy to redo the past ones. Also probably wouldn't help me anyways.

Just wanted to archive this since I was pretty proud of how much I learned.

Didn't do pset 9 but I did make a flask app (Reaction Timer, another repo on this account).
